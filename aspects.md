Phylogenetic trees

One most commonly comes across species trees, but these are infact an amalgam of different data and indeed different methods.

The molecular biology viewpoint is more focussed and typically concentrates on a certain gene, or a set of SNPs.

In Bacteria phylogenies are typically built 


Phylogenies and denovo assemblies.

De novo assemblies can be very rough, and can result in a highly fragmented set of scaffolds or contigs. Typcially one takes the scaffolds as 
the best finished product.

To build a phylogeny one must try and find appropriate genes. In the case of prokaryotes there's a very strong consensus towards using the 16S rRNA gene.
So finding the 16S gene in a denovo assebmly is a useful task.
