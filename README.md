# bioinfgloss

A tentative glossary of terms used within bioinformatics. Many of these are biology and genetics terms, and indeed there are plenty places on the internet to read their definitions, but because their nature is somewhat looser than the way computational terms are defined, the following includes accounting for this lack of tight meaning-to-word binding by at least admitting it exists.


I

Infinite sites model:
A term that dates from pre-sequencing days, which officially is defined as "Each gene is made of a sequence of sites, and each time a mutation occurs, it affects a site that was previously unaffected". Essentially this means that the number of mutations will be at least the number of sites affected, and never less. In other words, given a time period, mutations will not hit the same site twice (or more times) ever.



G

* Gene:
The molecular unit of heredity. It's not amiss to say that the definition, though quite stable in the 21st century, has gone through refinements in meaning in the past, and this fact reflects the "otherness" of the concept it belies: it has proved quite difficult to give it precise boundaries in meaning ever since Mendel first came up with the idea and called it "factor".


* T

Tandem Repeat
A sequence segment that repeats itself a regular distance apart. If this distance is the same as its length, the "tandem" may be left out.

Tandem Repeat Finder (TRF)
Very established tool often used by default by everyone for identifying tandem repeats. Only available as a binary.
