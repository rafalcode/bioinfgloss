* Eigensoft
Probably the most popular tool for PCA analysis, this consists of "smartpca" which does the main PCA analysis and also "eigenstrat" which takes into account the population structure.



* Orthomcl
For finding orthologs.

* Principal component analysis (PCA):
This is a widely used method casts a dataset onto an orthogonal, multidimensional system of axes of variation. Often, certain axes are very much more important than others, as revealed by their corresponding eigenvalues, and so the unimportant axes are often ignored, and so the method achieves the effect of reducing the dimensionality of problem, naking it easier to analyse.
